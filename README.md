This game is a game about surviving zombies for as long as you can. Each zombie you kill adds 1 to the score, and the higher your score gets, the harder the game gets (specifically increases in difficulty every 15 score earned)
To get started, press [E] to enter the game, and [F] to exit back to the title screen whenever you want.

Pro Tip: The Zombies can't see you if you're above them.
